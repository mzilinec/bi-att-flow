  "text": "Achieved skills and knowledge Design and Programming of Embedded Systems branch of study is focused on the design of embedded digital system, programmable systems and system-on-a -chip (SoC a NoC). The subject covers design, testing and analysis methods at the system level and at the lower abstraction levels as well. The branch is based on system theory, parallel systems and dicrete mathematics which are teached in the first year. It further enables to construct the actual profile of graduates based on knowledges of verification and simulation methods, testing, fault-tolerant, attack-resistant and reliable design methods, real-time applications, HW-SW codesign, reconfiguration and programmable hardware (FPGAs). The organization of teaching is based on lectures, seminars, labs and both individual and group projects. For information about courses visit study plan. Application in the branch Graduates of Design and Programming of Embedded Systems branch of study obtains the knowledges about the design, modeling and verification of digital systems, about the construction the systems with specified properties (real-time, fault-tolerant, safe-resistent or low-power ones), about the design and verification of a system architecture based on models and about system-on-a chip (SoC) and programmable hardware (SoPC, FPGA) design methods."
